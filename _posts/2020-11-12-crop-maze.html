Crop Maze it's an arcade survival shooter videogame implemented in java. 

We have used the architectural pattern Model-View-Control (MVC) to easilly separate the tasks between the components, personally I have written the code behind the player, the animations, a builder for all the entities and part of the movement.

This survival game is located in a farm that is invaded by aliens...

Your goal is to survive as long as possible collencting coins that allow you to buy upgrades for your character.
