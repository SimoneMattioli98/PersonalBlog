Hey, how is it going? I am Simone and this is the blog I created to share my professional figure and project with you.<br><br>
But first let me tell you a bit more about myself. I graduated at Bologna University in Computer Science Engineering and currently I'm a Master's degree student of Computer Engineering at Bologna University (Italy). <br><br>
I consider myself as an explorer. Indeed I don't have a favourite topic on which I spend most of my days but I just let myself get carried away by the ideas and project that pop up in my mind.<br><br>
My interests are AI, especially Deep Learning and Computer Visione, astronomy and general applications or anything that I thing might be cool creating.<br>
When I am not in front of a window I am a soccer player and a calisthenics athlete. I also love theater and I am part of a musical company with some friends of mine.<br><br>
What I really love about software, computer, coding and researching is that anything you can imagine or see in you mind, can be studied, created and made your own.
Sometimes for me the computer world seems like our universe...a huge container of knowledge and science and somewhere in there  there is (and always be) something that just needs to be discovered, and this is what makes me love what I do.
